       <strong><em>BROOKS & DUNN</em></strong> is an American <strong>Country Music</strong> duo consisting of <strong>Kix Brooks</strong> and <strong>Ronnie Dunn</strong> both of whom are vocalists and songwriters. The duo was founded in <strong> 1990</strong> through the suggestion of <strong> Tim DuBois.</strong> Before the foundation, both members were solo recording artists. Both members charted two solo singles apiece in the 1980s, with Brooks also releasing an album for Capitol Records in 1989 and writing hit singles for other artists. Founded in 1991, the duo signed to Arista Nashville that year. They have recorded <strong> 11 studio albums </strong> and five compilation albums for the label. They also have released <strong> 50 singles, </strong> of which 20 went to number one on the Hot Country Songs charts and 19 more reached top 10. Two of these number-one songs, <strong> My Maria </strong> (a cover of the B.W. Stevenson song) and <strong> Ain't Nothing bout You, </strong> were the top country songs of 1996 and 2001, respectively, according to the Billboard Year-End charts.
